Bolt Circle Array
=================

This program generates a circular array for canned drill cycles in a mill (ie 'bolt circle'). This program used face.py as a template, so it looks very similar. Some of the entry widgets have predefined values in them. Look carefully at these before pressing the 'Generate G-code' button. Note this generates a snippet of G code intended to be inserted into your G-code.
